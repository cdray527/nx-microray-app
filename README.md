# Nextjs, Nx and Module Federation

This is an example project to demonstrate how to use Nx, Next.js and Module Federation together.

> âš  This example depends on [@module-federation/nextjs-mf](https://app.privjs.com/package?pkg=@module-federation/nextjs-mf). It will not work unless you have access to this plugin, which is not free.

```bash
npx nx g @nrwl/next:page new-page --project=app-name
```

## Creating new components

To generate new components you can just use:
